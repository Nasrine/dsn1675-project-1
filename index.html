     My strength is my creativity. I have a passion for art and design. I enjoy many different types of art, but I had a chance to take a few certificates in Photography, Oil painting, and Pottery. I enjoy cooking, baking, food decorating, gardening, classical music and poem. I have two beautiful children and I am currently studying Graphic Design. I believe life is beautiful and very short, so we have to make the most of it.
